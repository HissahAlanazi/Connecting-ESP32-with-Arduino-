# In this project we are connecting ESP32 with Arduino :-                                                                                                               
So in First step we need to installing Arduino  :                                                                                                                       
# What is Arduino? -                                                                                                                                                   
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                      
Second step:                                                                                                                                                           
open the Arduino and connect the ESP32 in USP your laptop ,                                                                                                             
the code is auto written found in the arduino we need just open ,                                                                                                       
file -> Examples -> Basics -> Blink

<img width="960" alt="Arduino" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85851678/176402727-c5073106-6e69-46f7-805f-9bc63aa3f45c.png">
                                                                                                                                                                      
then choose the port because make sure the code is movement to the electronic chip ,                                                                                   
Tools -> Port -> COM6                                                                                                                                                   
Now the ESP32 will work .

If not work , then we need to call the library ESP32 because you didn't installing the library                                                                         
Tools -> Boards Manager -> search ESP32 and installing                                                                                                                   
If not found the library

You must do this step :                                                                                                                                             
add URL the library from                                                                                                                                       
File -> Preferences -> https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json and go back to                                                                             
Tools -> Boards Manager -> installing ESP32

# Now will work the ESP .
